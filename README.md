# ðŸŒ¿ AgriTrust â€“ Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025 Submission

AgriTrust is a decentralized agro-input traceability and subsidy verification platform built on the Hedera network (HCS + HTS). It enables farmers to verify seed and fertilizer authenticity using USSD, QR codes, and voice support, while ensuring transparent subsidy distribution for governments and NGOs.

## ðŸ§  Problem

Fake agricultural inputs and corrupt subsidy programs are destroying farmer trust and reducing yields across Africa. Traditional systems lack traceability, leading to major economic and social losses.

## Solution

- **Tamper-proof product tracking** on Hedera DLT  
- **USSD/QR/Voice-based verification** for low-tech farmers  
- **HTS-based token incentives** for verified purchases  
- **Real-time dashboard** for suppliers, NGOs, governments
  
## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Hedera HCS & HTS**  
- **React / Flutter**  
- **Firebase** (data & auth)  
- **Python or Node.js backend**  
- **IPFS** (for document/data storage)  
- **AI** (fraud anomaly detection - planned)

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

| Phase | Description |

|-------|-------------|
| Pilot | Ethiopia, focus on seed verification |
| Scale | Add fertilizer + government subsidy tracking |
| Expand | Cross-sector: vaccines, energy, etc. |
